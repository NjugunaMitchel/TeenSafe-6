<p>We have a large community receiving support across anxiety, depression, eating disorders and those battling self harm.

    If you're battling with mental health or struggling with self harm it can feel lonely, It can suck, and let’s admit it: that’s tough to say out loud. We all know that, and maybe, sometimes, we’ve just been made to feel a little afraid to say it. </p>
