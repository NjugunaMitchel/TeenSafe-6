<p>We have a large community receiving support across anxiety, depression, eating disorders and those battling self harm.

    If you're battling with mental health or struggling with self harm it can feel lonely, it can suck, and let’s admit it: that’s tough to say out loud. We all know that, and maybe, sometimes, we’ve just been made to feel a little afraid to say it. </p>

<h1>
    PEER SUPPORT
</h1>
<p>A peer supporter who offers a listening service is a person who has been trained in counselling skills that include active listening, verbal and non-verbal communication, confidentiality and problem solving. Peer supporters who have completed certain training may then go on to offer support to their peers on a formal basis.</p>

<h1>PEER EDUCATION</h1>
<p>This involves peers educating peers on specific topics, such as coping with depression, anxiety or addiction. This will generally include a group of peers of similar age, status and background to the people to whom they are delivering material.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="pes"> PEER TUTORING</h1>
<p id="sup">This  is a model whereby a peer supporter aids a peer, whether of the same age or younger, with his or her academic and social learning. The support offered by the peer tutor can be cross-curricular and take the form of paired reading or paired writing.</p>
