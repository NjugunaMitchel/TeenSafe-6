                    <h1>Drugs</h1>
                    <p>Lets face it, you most probably have encountered either friends or relatives with this substance. Maybe someone has lured you into trying to take them.Today will study what ita sctual does to your system.Most drugs affect the brain's "reward circuit," causing euphoria as well as flooding it with the chemical messenger dopamine. A properly functioning reward system motivates a person to repeat behaviors needed to thrive, such as eating and spending time with loved ones. Surges of dopamine in the reward circuit cause the reinforcement of pleasurable but unhealthy behaviors like taking drugs, leading people to repeat the behavior again and again.The more you take the drugs the lesser the 'high' you feel as the journey continues.In simple terms your system develops a tolerance for this behaviour.Intrestingly not all drug users become addicts.Why? some factors such as Biology,Development,Environment can conribute to the response of your body.For an indepth explanition to the factors you can visit <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction">Here</a> </p>
                    <p>As much as it 'feels good' to engage in this as a newbie the after effects are tremendous and not in a good way.Sit have a pep talk with yourself n decide if thats what you really should become</p>

                    <h1>Self esteem</h1>
                    <p>This is a very important and crucial topic for us teenagers.AS we develop we start to expirience changes mentally, physically and emonitionally.Lets talk looks for a minute.Just like everyone i will sing the same song..you are beautifully and wonderfully made oor handsomely and wonderfully made.Now this will not in anyway make a difference until you believe in it yourself.Physical appearance should not be the factor that determines the person you are.Not at all guys.like the popluar saying Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder and the beautiful ones are not yet born <span>Adult take for a moment</span> this is how we say it in the youth years...I might not be your cup of tea but am someone else's.What i mean is even if you are the most beautiful girl you know someone else will probably think your not and someone else  will harmonize with you. </p>
                    <p>All this narrows down to you don't need nobody to validate you.What people think or say should not in anyway affect you.</p>

                    <h1>Relationships & sex?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Alot of you ask what the right age is to get into a relationship with someone.The truth is there is nothing like the right age.You need to be prepared and mature enough to deal with the ups and downs of being in a relationship.Often are times when you get involved with a person owning to infatuation.You really don't like them ,they really like you, you break their heart and years down the line they are affraid of getting involved.Timing is key people.There is time for everything and everything is beautiful in it's own time.So why don't you be a good student and focus on your studies and friends then with time everything will fall into place.
